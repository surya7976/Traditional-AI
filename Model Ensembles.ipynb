In this technique, multiple models are used to make predictions for each data point. The predictions by each model are considered as a ‘vote’. The predictions which we get from the majority of the models are used as the final prediction.\n","\n","**Averaging**\n","* Similar to the max voting technique, multiple predictions are made for each data point in averaging. In this method, we take an average of predictions from all the models and use it to make the final prediction. Averaging can be used for making predictions in regression problems or while calculating probabilities for classification problems.\n","\n","**Weighted average**\n","* This is an extension of the averaging method.

The base estimators in random forest are decision trees. Random forest randomly selects a set of features and rows which are used to decide the best split at each node of the decision tree.\n","* Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our model’s prediction\n","\n","**Boosting**\n","* If a data point is incorrectly predicted by the first model, and then the next (probably all models), will combining the predictions provide better results? Such situations are taken care of by boosting.\n","* Boosting is a sequential process, where each subsequent model attempts to correct the errors of the previous model. The succeeding models are dependent on the previous model.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ruao_tE7CvY4","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716214709628,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":14793,"user":{"displayName":"Suryanarayana
