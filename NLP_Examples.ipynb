        "\n",
        "* Since the beginning of the brief history of Natural Language Processing (NLP), there has been the need to transform text into something a machine can understand. That is, transforming text into a meaningful vector (or array) of numbers. The de-facto standard way of doing this in the pre-deep learning era was to use a **bag of words** approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The idea behind this method is straightforward, though very powerful. First, we define a fixed length vector where each entry corresponds to a word in our pre-defined dictionary of words. The size of the vector equals the size of the dictionary. Then, for representing a text using this vector, we count how many times each word of our dictionary appears in the text and we put this number in the corresponding vector entry.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Bag of words indicates the count of each word in the document. This simple model is used, for example, in naive Bayes\n",
        "\n",
        "* Note that each row in a Document Term Matrix (DTM) corresponds to a word vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In text mining, it is important to create the **document-term matrix (DTM)** of the corpus we are interested in. A DTM is basically a matrix, with documents designated by rows and words by columns, that the elements are the counts or the weights (usually by tf-idf).\n",
        "\n",
        "* To improve this representation, you can use some more advanced techniques like removing stopwords, lemmatizing words, using n-grams or using tf-idf instead of counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The problem with this method is that it doesn’t capture the meaning of the text, or the context in which words appear, even when using n-grams.\n",
